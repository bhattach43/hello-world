# hello-world
Customary first GitHub repo.

Have dealt with GitHub only in the context of obtaining and installing open source software. Have used CVS and SVN for versioning of code and documents. Always interesting to learn new stuff!

Just found out that what looks like NEWLINE in the editor doesn't actually translate to a line break! Also looks like certain expression styles may be interpreted on the fly!
